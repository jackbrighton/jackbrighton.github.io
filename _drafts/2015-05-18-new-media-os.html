<p>The term “digital first” has gained currency in discussions about change in the media business.  It’s useful shorthand for change in the technologies of content production and its distribution over digital networks and devices. Digital first forces us to rethink our organizational models and staff skills, and retool for digital content production and distribution across all platforms.</p>

<p>It also fails to capture the most important aspect of the emerging media system.</p>

<p>As I think about how I use media now, it's basically on my own terms. The World Wide Web and social media have become my portals to most of the content I consume. But it's not just "consume." I have a multimedia studio in my pocket, and a global network at my fingertips. Through this I have found many people who share my interests. I have many different interests, so I'm connected with many different communities which overlap in various ways. We help each other understand more than we could alone, as we create, share, respond, and interact over time.</p>

<p>This is my personal network, and the relationships in it are based on shared interests and trust. As a citizen of the incresingly digital second decade of the 20th century, you have your network too. In it are people with whom we have strong or weak ties, short of longt relationships, and mutual support in various way. Just like any geographically-based community.</p>

<h2>The end is near for the Broadcast Era</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The ordinary person senses the greatness of the odds against him even without thought or analysis, and he adapts his attitudes unconsciously. A huge passivity has settled on industrial society. For people carried about in mechanical vehicles, earning their living by waiting on machines, listening much of the waking day to canned music, watching packaged movie entertainment and capsulated news, for such people it would require an exceptional degree of awareness and an especial heroism of effort to be anything but supine consumers of processed goods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Publishing used to require access to a printing press, and as a result the act of publishing something was limited to a tiny fraction of the population, and reaching a population outside a geographically limited area was even more restricted. Now, once a user connects to the internet, he has access to a platform that is at once global and free. It isn't just that our communications tools are cheaper; they are also better. In particular, they are more favorable to innovative uses, because they are considerably more flexible than our old ones.</p>

<p>Clay Shirky, Here Comes Everyone, 2008</p></blockquote> 

<p>Once upon a time newspapers, magazines, books, radio, television, and film were the dominant lifeforms in the media ecosystem. These pre-digital forms were part of our daily lives, and became part of our culture. To people born in the 20th century they were the very definition of media. These media enormously expanded our ability to percieve the world in real time. Because they were so ubuquitous and pervasive, they also disrupted forms of communication and communal life that were part of human culture for millennia.</p>

<p>Before they came along all entertainment was interactive: theatre, music, sport – the performers and audience were there together, and even a respectfully silent audience exerted a powerful shaping presence on the unfolding of whatever drama they were there for. We didn’t need a special word for interactivity in the same way that we don’t (yet) need a special word for people with only one head.</p>

<p>For the past century, our role in the media system was mostly limited to consumption. While celebrating the role of electronic media as "a means of extending and expanding our organinic sense lives into our environment," McLuhan also thought the industrialization of media technology also brought a sense of helplessness and passivity. "The ordinary person senses the greatness of the odds stacked against him, and he adapts his attitudes unconciously."</p>

<h2>Maybe this wasn't the case throughout most of human history. </h2>
<p>People want to be told stories, but they also want to tell them. They want to enjoy things created by others, but they also want to create. They usually want to be in relationships and communities. It may be possible that we are just now waking up from our passive role, and realizing that our new media system allows us to  participate.</p>

<h2>More Douglas Adams</h2>
<blockquote><p>I expect that history will show ‘normal’ mainstream twentieth century media to be the aberration in all this. ‘Please, miss, you mean they could only just sit there and watch? They couldn’t do anything? Didn’t everybody feel terribly isolated or alienated or ignored?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, child, that’s why they all went mad. Before the Restoration.’</p>
<p>‘What was the Restoration again, please, miss?’</p>
<p>‘The end of the twentieth century, child. When we started to get interactivity back.’</p>
