The term “digital first” has gained currency in discussions about change in the media business.  It’s useful shorthand for change in the technologies of content production and its distribution over digital networks and devices. Digital first forces us to rethink our organizational models and staff skills, and retool for digital content production and distribution across all platforms.

It also fails to capture the most important aspect of the emerging media system: the expanding role of personal networks.

As I think about how I use media now, it's basically on my own terms. The World Wide Web and social media have become my portals to most of the content I consume. But it's not just "consume," because I find myself creating media every day almost as a matter of course. I have a supercomputer and multimedia production studio in my pocket, and a global network literally at my findertips. Through this network I have found many people who share my interests. Since I have many different interests, I am connected with many different communities, many of which overlap in various ways. We all help each other understand much more about the world than we ever could alone as we create, share, respond, and interact over time.

This is my personal network, and the relationships in it are based on shared interests and trust. Within it are people with whom I have strong or weak ties, just like any geographically-based community. 

## The end is near for the Broadcast Era

I grew up in a time when newspapers, magazines, books, radio, television, and film were the dominant lifeforms in the media ecosystem. As a massive consumer of media, I still read paper-based content every day including my local newspaper. I subscribe to and dearly love The New Yorker. For years I produced public radio and television, and still have a passion for getting on the air whenever I have the chance. 

These media forms of the Broadcast Era seemed forever etched into the fabric of our culture. To people born in the 20th century, they were the very definition of media. But as revolutionary as they were, and as much as they expanded our ability to percieve the world across time and space, it turns out they also disrupted many forms of communication and community that were part of human culture for millennia.

For the past century, our role in the media system was mostly to consume. People want to be told stories, but they also want to tell them. They want to consume, but they also want to create. They want to form relationships and communities. We are just now waking up from our passive role, and realizing how our new media system allows us to participate.
