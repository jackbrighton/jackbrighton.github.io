The term “digital first” first gained currency in June 2011 when [the publisher of the Guardian announced plans to become a digital-first organization](http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/guardian-news-media-digital-first-organisation). A growing list of news organizations followed suit, including the Financial Times and the BBC. I ‘ve argued that for public broadcasting to remain relevant, we need to stop thinking of ourselves as broadcasters and become digital first. 

## We’ve got ourselves a real buzzword here. 

But what does “digital first” actually mean? Here are a few competing definitions:

- [Digital first, print (or broadcast) last](http://www.inma.org/blogs/integrated-advertising-sales/post.cfm/so-what-soes-digital-first-really-mean)
- [Producing stories for the web that can then be adapted and delivered via print and other mediums](http://www.epublishing.com/blogs/1-the-epublishing-blog/post/256-the-digital-first-publishing-strategy--it-s-about-time-)
- [Cross-platform roles at every level](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/key-lessons-from-digital-first-magazine-leaders/s2/a554179/) 
- [Make digital strategy everyone's job](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vala-afshar/digital-first_b_4975207.html)
- [Digital communication is the first thought not the afterthought](http://digitalbydefault.com/2012/09/29/digital-thirst/)
- [“A mode of being that promotes innovation and excellence”](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/428072/technology-review-goes-digital-first/)

No wonder we’re still confused. In all the hype about digital-first, I’m not sure there’s even a good definition of the word digital.

## Here’s my definition of digital first

_Digital-first is how we now produce media_. 

The term "digital" includes all previous forms of media, in digital formats on demand. Our core media technologies are now completely digital. We record, edit, and publish content using digital tools and platforms. We store, manage, and access media using computers, servers, and software. Digital technology is essential in every aspect of news reporting and content production. Even our transmitters are now digital.

Broadcasting continues to serve the largest audiences for our content. But rapid growth of users on Internet-based platforms foreshadows the day when online audiences will predominate. The digital shift is occurring even more rapidly with younger audiences, who are increasingly less likely to consume broadcast media or subscribe to cable or satellite television. Across all audiences, the adoption of mobile technology is outpacing any previous form of consumer media.

The digital shift is accelerating, and its time to accept that even broadcasting has become digital-first.


Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. [Resistance is futile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_%28Star_Trek%29).

We’re much better at producing content for our long-standing broadcast channels than we are for Internet-based and mobile channels. Yet it’s all digital content, crafted in particular ways. 

A digital-first production model would start by thinking of content as something that can be produced in different ways to fit the formats and strengths of multiple media platforms and channels: radio, television, syndication, websites, blogs, podcasts, social media, mobile apps, data presentations, interactives, maps, podcasts, the PMP, OTT devices, print, events, etc. 

We don’t have to use all platforms and channels for every bit of content, but it makes sense to leverage every possibility for adding value and reaching audiences everywhere we can.

Digital-first production requires additional skills. Crafting content for the web, social media, and OTT platforms requires not just digital audio, video, and image editing, but knowing the specific formats, writing styles, and metadata requirements for each platform.  Anyone can launch a WordPress blog, but going beyond the basics requires knowledge of good design practices with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Digital media production requires servers, networks, storage, user authentication, backups, and security.

Our organizational models often enforce departmental silos that inhibit development of a multidisciplinary approach. A digital team could include reporters and producers working alongside web developers, designers, marketing and analytics, IT and engineering staff, and buy-in from management that understands a culture of collaboration is essential in the digital media age.

## News reporters might not be great at building mobile apps

It’s natural to fear change on a personal level. Are my skills obsolete? Am I being asked to do new kinds of work I don’t understand? Will I still be valued if I admit what I don’t know? Is broadcasting still considered important? These fears are probably reinforced by recent events in Seattle, where [11 television production staff were laid off as KCTS shifted to what it called a “digital first” content model](http://current.org/2015/04/kcts-in-seattle-switches-to-digital-first-content-approach-cuts-11-employees/). 

Digital-first doesn’t mean a radio reporter must become an expert still photographer, videographer and video editor, user experience designer, social media expert, web designer, analytics guru, database administrator, and app developer. It doesn't mean people without "digital skills" aren't important anymore. 

But organizational models must change as we adopt new technologies and skills. We need someone producing photos for the website and social media. We need website content that isn’t copy-and-pasted from a radio script. We need to organize and manage audio, video, images, text, data, and other digital media. We need usable systems, training, and support for a digital-first workflow.  

Otherwise we’re left with trying to make digital a part of broadcasting when it should be the other way around. 

The fundamental barrier in moving from broadcasting-first to digital-first is our self-definition. If we think we’re broadcasters, we’ll only focus on broadcasting. If we understand ourselves as digital media professionals who do broadcasting along with many other things, we have a chance to be relevant in the coming decades.


## But digital-first isn’t enough

I started this blog with the intention of exploring ideas important to the future of public media. Digital-first is a concept we need for now, as we transition from a broadcast-first mentality. But let me state clearly for the record: I hope we can then _kill the term digital-first once and for all_.

Public media can adopt a digital-first approach to producing and distributing media. We can put the right skills in the right places, adjust our roles and organizational models, and learn to craft content for the full spectrum of digital platforms and channels. But it won’t be enough. 

Becoming digital-first public media is only the necessary first step in becoming something larger and more important than public broadcasting ever was. The term “digital first” fails to capture the most significant aspect of the emerging digital media system: its capacity to empower people not just to consume, but to participate.  

That’s a project worthy of the term “public media.”
