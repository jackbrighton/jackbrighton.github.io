<p>I started in public radio as a producer, and logged about 8000 hours over 15 years as producer and on-air host. I did a bunch of other public broadcasting stuff too, like television and boy was that fun! But then the Internet came beaconing as a way to extend the reach and impact radio, television, and everything else public broadcasting set out to do. I was hooked from Gopher on.</p>

<p>The Mosaic browser came out in 1994, and I've been building websites since 1998. So as a developer I'm a little behind the bleeding edge. But I like to think this has afforded me the long view, or what I call my superpower: <em>Macrovision</em>.</p>

<p>Macrovision is simply the ability to see patiently, so you're not just jumping at the latest squirrel. I think this is important when technology keeps changing and the squirrels are thick. I love learning things (programming, tools, musical instruments) but now there's too much for one person (me anyway) to learn completely. I use my macrovision to try and see where things came from, where they're going, and then to zoom in on the pieces we can truly leverage.</p>

<p>So then the question becomes, leverage in service of what? To what ends? I can't say this any better, so I'll quote Bill Siemering's public media mission statement from the early days of NPR:</p>

<blockquote>The total service should be trustworthy, enhance intellectual development, expand knowledge, deepen aural esthetic enjoyment, increase the pleasure of living in a pluralistic society and result in a service to listeners which makes them more responsive, informed human beings and intelligent responsible citizens of their communities and the world.</blockquote>

<p>And have some fun...yep, this is what we should do and I'm up for that.</p>
