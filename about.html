<p>I started in public media as a radio guy, and logged about 8000 hours as producer and on-air host. I did a bunch of other public broadcasting stuff, like television and that was fun! Then the Internet came beckoning as a way to extend the reach and impact radio, television, and everything else public broadcasting set out to do. I was hooked from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)" title="Gopher entry on Wikipedia">Gopher</a> on.</p>

<p>The Mosaic browser was developed about three blocks from my office at the University of Illinois. That got me pretty fired up. I started building websites and never looked back. But I think my history with the world of analog media (and the first versions of the Radio Shack TRS-80 but that's another story) set me up for the digital media age with a superpower: <em>Macrovision</em></p>

<p>Macrovision is simply the ability to see patiently instead of jumping at the latest shiny object. I think this is important when technology keeps changing and every day there are a dozen new shiny objects. I love learning things (programming, tools, musical instruments) but now there's too much for any one person (me anyway) to learn completely. I use my macrovision to try and see where things came from, where they're going, and then to zoom in on the pieces we can truly leverage.</p>

<p>Leverage in service of what? To what ends? I can't say this any better, so I'll quote Bill Siemering's public media mission statement from the early days of NPR:</p>

<blockquote>The total service should be trustworthy, enhance intellectual development, expand knowledge, deepen aural esthetic enjoyment, increase the pleasure of living in a pluralistic society and result in a service to listeners which makes them more responsive, informed human beings and intelligent responsible citizens of their communities and the world.</blockquote>

<p>And have some fun...</p>
