<h2>The President had it right...public broadcasting was just the beginning of public media</h2>

<p>As <a href="http://current.org/2015/04/cpb-finds-room-for-media-innovation-in-1967-public-broadcasting-act/">reported in Current</a>, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting recently conducted a new legal analysis of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, and concluded that the statute allows CPB to fund media projects beyond TV and radio. As so many of us now call ourselves public media, not public broadcasting, we should applaud this news.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while the statute is important as a legal framework, the spirit of the statute is reflected in <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=28532">President Lyndon Johnson's "Remarks Upon Signing the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967."</a></p>
<p>Some excerpts:</p>
<p><em>“So today we rededicate a part of the airwaves--which belong to all the people--and we dedicate them for the enlightenment of all the people.</em></p>
<p><em>“I believe the time has come to stake another claim in the name of all the people, stake a claim based upon the combined resources of communications. I believe the time has come to enlist the computer and the satellite, as well as television and radio, and to enlist them in the cause of education.</em></p>
<p><em>“If we are up to the obligations of the next century and if we are to be proud of the next century as we are of the past two centuries, we have got to quit talking so much about what has happened in the past two centuries and start talking about what is going to happen in the next century beginning in 1976.</em></p>
<p><em>“So I think we must consider new ways to build a great network for knowledge-not just a broadcast system, but one that employs every means of sending and of storing information that the individual can use….</em></p>
<p><em>“Eventually, I think this electronic knowledge bank could be as valuable as the Federal Reserve Bank. And such a system could involve other nations, too--it could involve them in a partnership to share knowledge and to thus enrich all mankind.”</em></p>
<p>In 1967 the first computer networks were just beginning to emerge from research at institutions like Stanford Research Center, Xerox PARC, and several other public universities who not coincidentally were also deeply involved in educational broadcasting. We were just beginning to imagine the possibilities for using computers and networks for purposes of education and public service. Whether or not LBJ’s remarks were based on an awareness of the specifics of this work, they foreshadow the media  world we live in today.</p>
<p>The definition and scope of public media needs to reflect the technologies and cultural practices of the times, and this new analysis by CPB is correct in addressing that reality. Or as LBJ also noted, “Yesterday's strangest dreams are today's headlines and change is getting swifter every moment.”</p>
