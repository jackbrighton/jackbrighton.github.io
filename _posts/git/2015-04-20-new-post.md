Inspired by certain people (thanks Mel!) and convinced it couldn't be that difficult, I dedicated the past weekend to setting up a blog on GutHub using Jekyll. Turns out it could be that difficult, but by some combination of multiple online tutorials and brute force, I finally got it working!

### Yay for Me

Jekyll provides some amazing features, which became evident when I stopped fighting with it. I've been building website in CMS platforms for nine years, so it seemed odd not having a database to throw things into and extract thru templates/themes. To my surprise, much of the syntax in Jekyll templates echos the typical development workflow in CMS templates. Basically, it's all variables inserted into structure (either html or Markdown, your pick), and of course a config file for site-wide values.

After getting through the technical barriers, it's time to write.
