<p>Public broadcasting in the United States was founded on the principle that the airwaves belong to the public. As the network of public TV and Radio stations grew and became professionalized, it retained its high ideals about public service. But now digital technology enables anyone with a passion for public service to participate in a new kind of global media system that is increasingly leaving broadcasting behind. So far public broadcasting has embraced the new digital public space only on its terms. </p>
